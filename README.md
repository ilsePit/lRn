# lRn
This is a repository with resources to learn some basic R and RMarkdown, using RStudio. Lots of things are possible using these tools, but I will focus on the necessary elements to understand conduct Social Science research. A quick explanation of the name of this repository (i.e. this page and all materials): for some reason there is a tradition in R tools to have punny names. The pronounciation of this repo (short for repository) is "learn" :).

## Set up
First things first: see instructions on how to download R and RStudio [here](https://datacarpentry.org/R-genomics/index.html#setup_instructions). The linked page also instructs you to install tidyverse and RSQLite, but this is *not necessary*. If you prefer a youtube tutorial, [here is a one on installation for Windows 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZxSA80lF1I).

## Start lRning
I have added a few scripts and files to play with in this repository. Learning R will always be an ongoing process, and I have added a few resources below to get started, learn more, and keep handy while coding in R.

### This repo
This repo is a work in progress, and I will add materials as necessary. The following material can be found right now:

#### Intro to base R
In 2018 I gave an introduction to R for [RLadies Amsterdam](https://github.com/rladiesamsterdam/2018_May_IntrotoR). I've adjusted the assignments and slides for use here.
- [intro-base-R.R](https://github.com/ilsePit/lRn/blob/main/intro-base-R.R): script with some very basic R commands, upto creating a dataframe and saving it
- [RLadiesAMS_2018May24.pdf](https://github.com/ilsePit/lRn/blob/main/RLadiesAMS_2018May24.pdf): slides with accompanying explanation

#### to come
- how to read csvs using read.csv and read.csv2

If you have any requests, feel free to let me know via the issues page or by shooting me a message.

### Handy resources

#### Cheat sheets
RStudio has an overview cheat sheets with some of the most common code for different tasks. Some of my favorites:
- [Cheat sheet base R](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/master/base-r.pdf)
- [Cheat sheet RStudio IDE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/master/rstudio-ide.pdf)
- [Cheat sheet RMarkdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf)
- [Cheat sheet Data Visualization using ggplot2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf)

#### Google / Stack Overflow
A big part of learning how to code in R is simply learning what to google for. Googling error messages and questions about your code will often lead you to pages like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) where people have asked, and hopefully answered, the same questions before.
