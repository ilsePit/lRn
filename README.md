This is a repository with resources to learn some basic R and RMarkdown, using RStudio. Lots of things are possible using these tools, but I will focus on the necessary elements to understand conduct Social Science research.

## Set up
First things first: see instructions on how to download R and RStudio [here](https://datacarpentry.org/R-genomics/index.html#setup_instructions). The linked page also instructs you to install tidyverse and RSQLite, but this is *not necessary*.

## Suggested materials for learning

## Resources
